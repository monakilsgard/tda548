**** Exercises week 4 ***


-   If you're new to programming, do as many exercises as possible, 3 and 4 will prepare for lab3
    Do left over exercises later or as exam recap.


General comment: Rather hard exercises.

Learn to search: Try to find what you need in the existing classes (String, etc), avoid
to implement whats already existing!

Exercises
---------

1.  See Ex1WordCount. Implement a method that calculates the number of word in a text.

2.  See Ex2Argots. Implement a method to translate to the Robber language and a method to

    See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6varspr%C3%A5ket and
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin

    Use functional decomposition if methods too big. Use methods from String and StringBuilder.

3.  See Ex3ReadNumber. Implement method readNumber.
    Must use: List/ArrayList, StringBuilder!

    week4/Ex3ReadNumber skall inledas med detta
    // Argument 0 is index to start looking for digits.
    // Return value is index directly after last read digit
    out.println(readNumber(numbers, "1", 0) == 1);
    // The number should be in the list numbers (method should add number to list)
    out.println(numbers.contains("1"));

4.  See Ex4CheckParen. Implement method to check parentheses matching for (), [] and {}.
    Must use a stack (= Dequeue/ArrayQueue in Java).
