**** Exercises week 4 ***


-   If you're new to programming, do as many exercises as possible, 3 and 4 will prepare for lab3
    Do left over exercises later or as exam recap.


General comment: Rather hard exercises.

Learn to search: Try to find what you need in the existing classes (String, etc), avoid
to implement whats already existing!
